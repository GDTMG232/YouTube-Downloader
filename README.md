This is just a YouTube downloader, let's be honest.<br>
you also need ffmpeg installed. find here: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html <br>
<br>
<h1>How it works</h1><br>
Basically, just run YouTube Downloader.py and if it doesnt run, just run InstallYTDLP.bat, then try again.<br>
You'll be meet by the following:<br>
"v or a<br>
<br>
v = video download, a = audio download<br>
or do na/an for both<br>
or \"exit\" to quit.<br>
<br>
|"<br>
<br>
If you want a video download, type v then press enter, then provide a YouTube video or playlist URL, it will save to a folder called Video in the same directory as your YouTube Downloader.py download.<br>
If you want an audio download, type a then press enter, then provide a YouTube video or playlist URL, it will save to a folder called Audio in the same directory as your YouTube Downloader.py download.<br>
<br>
<h2>If none of that works</h2><br>
<b>Did you change anything?</b> No?<br>
<b>Redownload it then.</b><br>
