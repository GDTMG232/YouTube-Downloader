This is just a YouTube downloader, let's be honest.<br>
you also need ffmpeg installed. find here: [https://ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-git-full.7z) <br>
<br>
<h1>How it works</h1><br>
Basically, just run YouTube Downloader.py and if it doesnt run, just run InstallYTDLP.bat, then try again.<br>
You'll be met by the following:<br>
"v or a<br>
<br>
v = video download, a = audio download<br>
or do na/an for both<br>
or \"exit\" to quit.<br>
<br>
|"<br>
<br>
If you want a video download, type v then press enter, then provide a YouTube video or playlist URL, it will save to a folder called Video in the same directory as your YouTube Downloader.py download.<br>
If you want an audio download, type a then press enter, then provide a YouTube video or playlist URL, it will save to a folder called Audio in the same directory as your YouTube Downloader.py download.<br>
<br>
<h2>If none of that works</h2><br>
<b>Did you set the ffmpeg location correctly in fflocation.py?</b> No? Do that then.<br>
<b>Did you do everything required?</b> Yes? You probably need to update yt_dlp or Youtube Downloader, check below.<br>
<br>

<h3>And also..</h3><br>
updates.py is not required to download, and even if you did, it wouldn't do anything for you anyway.
<br>
<br>
<br>
run "pip install --upgrade yt_dlp" every month or so just to make sure it doesnt bug out :)
<br><br>im so kind i made it open source <i>cuz some people dont trust these things to not be viruses, its open source so you can check it lol</i>
